TORQUE Resource Manager

Software Version 4.2.0

		                   	-------- WARNING! --------

TORQUE 4.2.0 is not backwards compatible in any way with versions 3.x and 2.x. When you upgrade to 4.2.0, 
everything has to be upgraded at once.

OVERVIEW

    TORQUE needs to be able to scale to newer, larger systems. This includes:
    handling larger numbers of jobs, nodes, and commands per second. TORQUE 
    also needs to become far more reliable. To respond to these challenges,
    TORQUE has undergone a huge makeover - pbs_server is now multi-threaded,
    RPP/UDP is no longer used, mom reporting can be organized into 
    hierarchies, job reporting can be divided into a tree structure, and 
    many other smaller yet significant changes.
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S NEW


    pbs_server is now multi-threaded so that it will respond to user commands 
    much faster, and most importantly, one user command doesn't tie up the 
    system and block other things.

    TORQUE no longer uses rpp to communicate - tcp is used in all cases. rpp 
    allows the network to drop its packets when it is at a high load. tcp 
    does not allow this in the protocol, making it more reliable.

    TORQUE now has the option of using a mom hierarchy to specify how the moms report
    to the server. If not specified, each mom will report directly to the server as 
    previous versions have, but if specified direct traffic on the server can be 
    greatly reduced. Details on providing a mom hierarchy file are found here:
    http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/resources/docs/torque/4-0/help.htm in 
    section 1.3.2 
    (1.0 Installation and configuration > 1.3 Advanced configuration > 1.3.2 Server configuration)
    
    pbs_iff has been replaced with a daemon that needs to be running on any
    submit host (under the condition that you are using iff, not munge or unix
    sockets) To start the iff replacement, run trqauthd as root.

    TORQUE now includes a job_radix option (-W job_radix=X) to specify how
    many moms each mom should communicate with for that job. Moms are then an 
    n-branch tree communications-wise

    More detail can be found in README.new_in_4.0

New with 4.2.4.1.h1

4.2.4.1.h1 has had the trqauthd client from 4.2.5 backported. This client has the ability
to shutdown trqauthd using a -d argument. Previously only a kill or pkill could be used 
to shutdown trqauthd.

In order to fix a problem where client commands would sometimes fail with an invalid credential
error the trqauthd and pbs_server were changed and the protocol between them added an address
field which is not in earlier trqauthd and pbs_server implementations. Because of this
pbs_server and all trqauthd daemons in the cluster must be upgraded together. 

REQUIREMENTS
------------

4.2.x is now compiled using C++. An ANSI Ci++ compiler is required.   The native Ci++ compiler is recommended if it
is ANSI, otherwise use g++.

A fully POSIX make is required.  If you are unable to "make" PBS with your
make, we suggest use of gmake from GNU.

Tcl/Tk version 8 or higher is required if you plan to build the GUI portion
of TORQUE or use a Tcl based scheduler.


BUILD AND INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS
---------------------------------

The directions to build and install are found in the PBS Administrators Guide.
A postscript and PDF copy are found in this directory.  Please read and
follow the directions CAREFULLY.

Also consider additional considerations in README.building_40.
